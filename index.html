      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Mechanical watches are prized for their craftsmanship and precision engineering. Unlike quartz watches, 
            which are battery-powered, mechanical watches are powered by intricate movements of gears and springs. 
            This traditional watchmaking technique requires exceptional skill to assemble and fine-tune, making each 
            mechanical watch a masterpiece of art and technology. Collectors and enthusiasts often appreciate these watches 
            for their complexity, aesthetic appeal, and the craftsmanship involved in their creation.</p>

      <label for="accordion-item-2" class="accordion-toggle">How Do I Care for My Luxury Watch?</label>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Caring for your luxury watch involves regular maintenance and careful handling. It's recommended to have your 
            watch serviced every 3-5 years by a certified professional to ensure its mechanism remains accurate and functional. 
            Keep your watch away from extreme temperatures and magnetic fields, which can affect its performance. For cleaning, 
            lightly wipe it with a soft, dry cloth. If your watch is water-resistant, ensure the crown is fully secured before 
            exposing it to water. Lastly, store your watch in a dry, cool place, preferably in a watch box to protect it from dust 
            and scratches.</p>

      <label for="accordion-item-3" class="accordion-toggle">Can I Wear My Watch While Swimming or Diving?</label>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Whether you can wear your watch while swimming or diving largely depends on its water resistance rating. 
            Watches are typically rated by their water resistance depth (e.g., 30 meters, 50 meters, 100 meters). A watch 
            with a water resistance of at least 50 meters is suitable for swimming, though for diving, you would want a watch 
            rated at 200 meters or more. Always check your watch's specifications before exposing it to water. Remember, water 
            resistance is not a permanent condition and can be affected by aging of gaskets or accidental impacts; it's advisable 
            to have the water resistance checked annually if you frequently expose your watch to water.</p>
